# Go Smarty Reader

The smart meter (called _Smarty_) deployed in Luxembourg allows the user to access a predefined set of data over the P1 port, a serial read-only interface, like its counterpart in the Netherlands.
However the data stream in Luxembourg is encrypted using the AES128-GCM algorithm (see the [specification](https://www.nexxtlab.lu/download/453/)), which raises the barrier for anyone interested in their own energy consumption.
This is where Go Smarty Reader comes into play: handling the serial connection, decrypting the Smarty telegrams, optionally publishing the measurements via MQTT, and with Golang as basis it easily compiles for different platforms.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. If the explanations here are insufficient to your needs, please take a look at our [blog post](https://www.nexxtlab.lu/smarty-dongle/), where you will find additional details.  

### Prerequisites

Have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and properly set up.

In order to connect Smarty to your machine you will need a P1 Cable (Dutch name: _Slimme Meter Kabel P1_), or build it yourself as seen on [weigu.lu](http://weigu.lu/microcontroller/smartyreader/index.html).
Furthermore ask your electrical grid operator for your decryption key.


### Installing

Run the following command to get a local copy of the project
```
go get github.com/NEXXTLAB/go-smarty-reader
```
After this you need to get the project dependencies. Either you 'go get' all four of the third party libraries listed at the bottom, or you use [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) with your console points to the project directory.
```
dep ensure
```

### Running the examples

Please find all prepared examples inside of [cmd/](https://github.com/NEXXTLAB/go-smarty-reader/tree/master/cmd). In order to run any example you should take note of following command-line arguments:
* key: your device specific decryption key
* device: the interface on which the smart meter is connected to your target platform
* stderrthreshold: allows to adjust the console output of glog, see [here](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/mesos/trunk/third_party/glog-0.3.1/doc/glog.html?p=1197837) for more details

The key should be, as mentioned earlier, requested from your electricity grid operator. To set the device argument, you will need to find the correct interface. Here a quick How-To:
* Windows: open your *Device Manager*, expand the *Ports* section, find the correct device and write down the COM port (eg. COM8)
* Linux: open your terminal and run *dmesg*. Plug in your P1 cable and write down the device name (eg. /dev/ttyUSB2)

Navigate to the project main directory, then run:
```
go run ./cmd/OnlineDecryption/main.go -key yourKey -device yourInterface -stderrthreshold=INFO
```
Now you should see every 10 seconds the result of a decrypted Smarty telegram in your console. Please find the meaning of the OBIS codes in the [specification](https://www.nexxtlab.lu/download/453/)  

You may swap the *OnlineDecryption* part of the path to any other example found in the [cmd/](https://github.com/NEXXTLAB/go-smarty-reader/tree/master/cmd) folder. Not every example requires all arguments.


## Running the tests

Currently there is only one test, additions welcome!
```
go test github.com/NEXXTLAB/go-smarty-reader/smarty/
```

## Build

In order to build the project simply run the [go build](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) command inside the project directory.
[The Go Cookbook](https://golangcookbook.com/chapters/running/cross-compiling/) offers a short overview on how to cross compile for a target platform different from yours. 
After you get your platform specific binary, you may run it in your console using the arguments found in the [Running the examples](#running-the-examples) section.
